    "   Linearity: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.  \n",
    "   Homoscedasticity: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.  \n",
    "   Independence: Observations are independent of each other.  \n",
    "   Normality: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed.  \n",
